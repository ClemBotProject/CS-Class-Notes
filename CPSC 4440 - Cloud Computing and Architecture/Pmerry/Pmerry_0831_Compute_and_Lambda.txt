CPSC 4400 - Cloud computing - 8/31


is the 750ti 1, 2, or 4 GB
	how many transcode seams too (13 is the 2GB or 4GB)

1050 ti has 4gb Vram

Amazon EC2
	

Docker
	a software platform that enables build, test, and deploy apps quickly
	you run a docker container
		containers created from a template called an image

	A container has everything a software application needs to run

Containers vs VMs
	VM has 
		infrastructure
			hypervisor
				VM 1
					App A
						EC2 instance OS
					App B
						EC2 instance OS 
			
				VM 2
				...
				VM N

	Look back at notes for the container


Amazon elastic container service (ECS)
	Scalable, fast, container management service
	
	benefits
		orchestrates exewc of docker containers
		maintains and scales the fleet of nodes that run containers
		removes complexity of standing up the infrastructure

	integrated w/ features familiar to amazon EC3 service users
		load balancing (elastic)
		Amazon EC2 security groups
		Amazon EBS volumes
		IAM roles


Kubernetes
	Open source software for container orchestrartion
		deploy and manage containerized applications at scale
	Complements Docker
		docker enables you to run multiple containers on a single OS host
		kubernetes orchestrates mutliple docker hosts (nodes)

	Automates
		container provisioning
		networking
		load distribution
		scaling

	Amazon EKS is amazon elastic kubernetes service
		enables you to run kubernetes on AWS
	
	Use EKS to
		manage clusters of amazon EC2 compute instances
		run containers that are orchestrated by kubernetes on those instances

	Manages a cluster of compute instances called nodes
		manages resources on the nodes

	Works with "layer abstraction"
		Ie it doesnt matter if the whole EC2 instances is a docker container or one EC2 has multiple docker instances

Amazon Elastic Container Registry
	


Containers can hold everything an app needs to run
docker is a containerization technology
Amazon ECS orchestrates execution of docker containers
Kubernetes orchestrates the containers 
Amazon EKS enables kubernetes on AWS
Amazon ECR enabbles you to store, manage, and deploy your docker containers



AWS lambda: run code without servers
	AWS is a serverless compute service
	Upload code
		the code ytou run is a Lambda fxn
		ruyn your code on sched or on events
			your code only runs when triggered
				pay only for compute time you use



	Function code
	Dependencies (code libraries etc)
	execution role

Takeaways
	Serverless computing does so without provisioning servers 
	AWS lambda is serverless compute servce with fault tolerance and auto scaling
	An event source is an AWS service or dev created application that triggers a lambda fxn
	the max mem alloc of a lambda fxn is 3008 MB
	the max exec time is 15 mins
