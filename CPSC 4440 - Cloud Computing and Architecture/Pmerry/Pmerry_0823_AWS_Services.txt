CPSC 4400 - Intro To Cloud Computing

Cloud Billing
	Cost Drivers
		Compute
			Charged per instance hour or second - Linux Only
			varies by instance type
		Storage
			charged per GB
		Data Transfer
			Outbound is aggregated and charged
			inbound has no charge (with rare exceptions)
			charged per GB

	Paying
		Pay only for what you use
		pay less when you reserve
			save up to 75%
				
		pay less when you use more and as AWS grows
			AWS focuses on lowering cost of doing business
			practice results in AWS passing along savings of economies of scale

	Custom Pricing
		meet varying needs with custom price
		for high-vol projects


	Services w no charge
		Amazon VPC
		Elastic Beanstalk
		Auto Scaling
		AWS cloudformation
		AWS Identity and Security/access Management


	Key takeaways
		no long term contracts


Cost Of Ownership
	costs of running a system of running AWS Cloud

	Owning own hardware has high up front cost
	cost of setup
	no opportunity to scale down


	Cloud infrastructure ready immediately
	only pay for what you use
	has the staff needed 
	Self service infrastructure

Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO)
	compare the costs of running an entire datacenter to using AWS


	










Global Infrastructure Overview
	
	AWS Region
		a geographic area
		
	Data replication across regions is controlled by you
	comms between regions uses AWS backbone network infrastrucuture

	A region consists of 2+ availability zones/datacenters

Selecting a region
	Data Governance, legal requirements	
	proximity to customers
	services available within region
	costs

Availability zones
	A fully isolated partition of AWS infrastructure
	There are 69 worldwide
	Designed for fault isolation
	they are interconnected with other zones for high speed private networking
	You choose your availability zones
	
	AWS recommends replicating data and resource  redundency

AWS Data centers
	AWS data centers are designed for security
	Data centers are where data resides and data processing occurs
	Each data center has redundant  power, networking ,and connectivity and IS housed in a separate facility
	A data center has between 50K-80K physical servers


Points of presence
	AWS provides global network of 187 points of presence location
	176 edge locations and 11 regional edge caches

	Use with amazon CloudFront
	Regional edge caches used for content with infrequent access


	AWS infrastructure features
		Elasticity and scalability
			dynamic adaptation of capacity
			scalable infrastructure, adapt to accomodate growth

		Fault Tolerance
			Continues operating properly in presence of failure
			built in redundancy of components

		High availability
			High level of operational performance
			minimize downtime


AWS foundation services
	compute (virtual, automatic scaling, load balancing)
	networking
	storage (object, block, archive) - provides virtualized mountable drives much like a virtual machine

		Amazon S3 glacier - very cheap archival storage


AWS Compute Services
	EC2 = server 

	scaling entails adding or removing EC2 instances
	AWS defaults decently

AWS Database Services
	Amazon Relational Database Service
	Amazon Aurora - MySQL/PostGress compatible but faster
	Amazon Redshift - data warehousing offering. Massive storage
	Amazon DynamoDB - a nosql database. Single Digit millisecond performance


AWS Security, identity, and compliance services
	IAM - identity and access management
