Designing Your Evnironment

how many azs should you use
	2+
	avoid single points of failure
	use elastic load balancer to balance traffic

vpc
	logically isolated from other networks
	must be accessible on standard network protocols


	limited use cases for a single vpc
		high perf computer envs
		microsoft active directory for identity management
		small single apps managed by small team

Majority of aws doesnt sit in vpc
	network traffic between aws regions traverse aws global network backbone by defualt
	sometimes traffic between regions uses public internet
	amazon s3 and dynamodb offer vpc enfpoints to connect without traversing public internet.

Dividing vpc into subnets
	public subnets
		subnet traffic routed to igw
	private subnet
		no route to an internet gateway

Use subnets to define accessibility
	Private subnets
		do not have routing table entry to igw and arent accessible from pub internet
		use a jump box (NAT/Proxy/Bastion host)in a pub subnet to get to it

ONE PUBLIc/Private subnet PER ZONE

ALLOCATE MORE IP ADDRS FOR PRIVATE SUBNETS
	you want to minimize addresses exposed to publix - IE ATTACK SURFACE

Consider larger subnets over smaller ones (/24 and larger)
	simplifies workload placement
		choosing to place workload in 10 small subnets is more complicated than one large one
		less likely to waste or run out of IP addrs
			if subnet runs out, you cant add more
	

Controlling VPC Traffic
	Route tables, sec groups, network ACLs, igws

	route tables
		determine where traffic goes
		main (defualt) and custom route tables
		All route tables include local entry - cannot be deleted
	
	Security Groups	
		Stateful apps that act as firewall controlling in/outbout traffic for 1+ instances

		By default - deny all inbound traffic
	
		uses cidr block or sg to create layers of security to define access to assets
		can span availability zones

		any instance can be in multiple security groups

		By defualt SGs allow outbound traffic but deny inbound
		Most orgs create SGs with inbound rules for each teir in the applicaiton

	Network ACls
		Virtual firewall at subnet level
		allow all incoming outgoing traffic and use stateless rules to allow/deny traffic
		stateless rules inspect all inbound and outbound traffic, dont track connections
		an allow rule must be created explicitly
