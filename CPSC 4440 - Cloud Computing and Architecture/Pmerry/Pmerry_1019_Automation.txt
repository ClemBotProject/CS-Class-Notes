Best practice - Automate the environment
	

Treat servers and components as temporary resources
	automate deployment of new resources with identical confiugs
	terminate resources not in use
	switch to new IP automatically
	test uploads on new resources, and replace old resources with updated ones

Operate infrastrucutre like code
	make it repeatablke


AWS CloudFormation
	Allows you to launch and config/connect aws resources with JSON or YAML


	json2yaml.com

How should you group resources in an automation template
	Structure is important, assign resources to templates based on ownership and application lifecycles

	At a min, separate network, security, and app resources into their own templates
	

template
	starts with description
	goes to optional metadata (includes settings/ configs or info that cloudform needs to retrieve)
		can be specified at template or resource level
	parameters
	mappings
		place resources in a certain area
	conditions
		control if resources are assigned properties or a value during stack creation or update
	Resources
		view template.png
		you may have a DependsOn attribute - this controls order resources come online
	outputs
	
CloudFormation allows for custom resources to plug in your own logic for stack creation
