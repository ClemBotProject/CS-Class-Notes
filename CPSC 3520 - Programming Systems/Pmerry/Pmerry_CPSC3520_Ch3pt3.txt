Backtracking
	multiple problem solutions leads to need for alternate paths to be examined

	Prolog marks alternatives for investigation (called backtracking)

The ; operator asks 'is there any solution, go back to last point of backtracking"

The cut operator - !
	notationally this is a predicate

	the cut means - ALL BACKTRACKING POINTS SO FAR ARE ERASED

	IE cut forces commitment ot hte currently found solution.

	the cut always will succeeds/evals to true

	
 
The not operation - not/1
	not succeeds if the unification of its only argument fails
		this is distinct from a raised exception from a nonexisting predicate


the call predicate
	invoke a goal which could be a binding on a variable
		recall the capital is reserved for variables

	What if variables bindings take on names of predicates?
		think function pointers
