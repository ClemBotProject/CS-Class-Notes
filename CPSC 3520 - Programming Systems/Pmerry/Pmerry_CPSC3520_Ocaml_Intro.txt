Ocaml Pragmatics
ocaml.org

Install Ocaml 4.05/4.07
	Dont use OPAM
	Use With a system package supported by your platform... (Use linux)
	
	Follow Documentation > Ocaml Manual > the HTML files (local copy)
		Need for intro
		contains langauge syntax
		Ocaml Libraries
		
	uses extension .ml

	OCAML doesnt do any 'readline'


	how to get realine functionality
		get the executible 'ledit'
		run it with ledit ocaml
			gives some command line interpretation
	
	how to exit
		use hte command #quit;;

Ocaml type inference
	you dont have to specify types
	Ocaml is strongly typed
	
	+ is integer addition, float addition is +.
	this allows to maintain a strong type without any declaration

	You can init a list by doing brackets with elements seperated by SEMICOLONS
		in ocaml, all elements of a list must be of the same type
		This is because the polymorphic list operations expect all elements to be the same type

	
	
to interpret a file from ocaml source
	syntax is

		#use"<filename.caml>";;

	
some ocaml semantics

	the option 
		avector@avector concatenates avector w itself


	Multivariable passing
		gets done with tupling or with currying
			tupled elements will get put together as (a1,a2)
				
	rec identifier shows the function is recursive to the interpreter

	with ocaml it can be helpful to use 'if then else' -> IE PROVIDE TERMINATION CONDITIONS WITH RECURSION
		note the else is required in ocaml 

	prototypes and signatures are both important
