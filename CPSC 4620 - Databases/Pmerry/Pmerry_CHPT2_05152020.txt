Database sys concepts and architecture

Data model
	a set of concepts to describe the stucture of a database
		operations ot manip
		constraints to obey
	

Data model and constraints
	Define database structure
	constructs typically incl elements, groups of elements, and relations among groups


Conceptual data model
	based off concepts of the real world to percieve data
	
Phyiscal data models
	relates to how data stores on disk

Implementation data models
	falls between conceptual and physical - how do you store real world on disk? what does DBMS understand?

Self describing
	combine description w data values 

Schema
	description of database
	incl descriptions of structre, datatype, etc

Schema diagram
	a display illustrative of the database schema
Schema construct
	a component of the schema or object within 

Database state/instance
	what is stored at any moment in time
	ALL data in the database at any time 

initial database state - what is initially loaded in system

Valid state
	a state that satisfies constraints of database


Schema - changes very infrequently, structure is consistent
Database state - actual data, changes with every update

three schema architecture

	proposed to support
		program data independence 
		support multiple views of data

	not explicitly used in commercial DBMS, but useful to describe sys org

internal schema
	where things are stored
	how we access them

conceptual schema
	describe sturcure oand constraints for database
	for a community of uses

external schemas
	describes various user views
	may be extention of conceptual schema in some cases

mappings among schema levels azre needed to transform data
	progs refer to internal schema and are mapped by DBMS...



Logical data independence
	capacity to change conceptual schema without changing the external schemas

Phys data independence
	capacity to change internal schema without changing conceptual schema
	ex internal might change when file structures are reorganized or  new indexes created to improve performance 

when a schema at a lower level is changed, only mappings between higher level schemas need to be changed in a DBMS that supports data independence 
the actual higher level schema can remain unchanged 

DAtabase system utilites
	loading data stored in files into databas
		incl data conversion tools

	backup database

	reorganize file structure
	performance monitoring utilites
	report generation 
	sorting, monitoring, compression, etc 

Centralized DBMS
	combines everything into a single system
	incl
		DBMS software
		hardware
		aplication programs
		user interface processing software
		user can still connect through remote terminal, all processing done centrally

2 tier client server architecture 
	specialized servers with specialized fxns
		print server 
		file server 
		DBMS server 
		web server 
		email server
	clients access specialized servers as needed 

DBMS server 
	provides db query and transaction services to clients
	relational DBMS servers are often called SQL servers, query serves, or transaction servers

Applicationps running on clients utilize an application program interface (API) to aqccess server databases via standard interface

client and server must install proper client module and server module for OBDC or JDBC

Client prog may connect to several DBMSs and sometimes called data sources

In general, data sources can be files or other non DBMS software to manage data



Is the three teir server architecture like Model/view/controller? 
	IE 
		client = view
		application server/web server = controller (facilitates the interaction of DB and client)
		Database server = model (the actual represention of data and operations to manipulate the data)
