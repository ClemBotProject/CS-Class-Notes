Database and Database Users
	Traditional applications are numeric/textual data

	Recent applications
		media
		geographic info systems
		data warehous
		mobile databases
		real time and active databases


Database
	collection of related data
	
Data
	facts that can be recorded and have an implicit meaning
Mini-world
	some part of the world about which data is stored in a database
	for ex, student grades and transcrupts at uni
Database Management System
	A software package/sys to facilitate the creation and maintenance of 
	computerized database

Database System
	The DBMS software together with data itself
	sometimes the apps are also included

DBMS functionality
	Define a database in terms of types, structure, and constraints
	Construct or load the initial contents on secondary storage medium
	Manipulation
		Retrieval
		Modification
		Accessing through web applications
	Processing and Sharing by set of concurrent users and application programs while keeping data valid and consistent 


Queries - access parts of data and formulate as result of req

Transactions - may read and update values ort generate new data 

Data abstraction
	a data model is used to hide storage details and present the users with a conceptualized view

 Concurrency control - guarantees each transaction is correctly executed or aborted

Database users
	two groups
		Actors on the scene - design and use database conten
		Workers behind the scene - design dbms software and tools  

Adv Of databases
	Controlling redundancy in data storage and in dev and maintenance efforts
	Restricting unauthorized access to data, only DBA staff have privelege
	Providing consistent storage for program objects
	Providing storage structures for easy query processing
	provide optimimization for efficient processing
	backup/recovery
	Provied interfaces to different classes of users
	Represnting complex relationships among data
	Drawing inferences and actions from the stored data using deductive
		and active rules and triggers
	Databases enforce STandards
		refers to data item names, display formats, screens, report structures, meta data, etc. 

DBMS Drawback
	high initial investment for hardware
	overhead is very general and requires lots of concerns

When to use databases
	Not to use:
		if database and app is well defined, simple, and wont change (think like a program to evaluate quadratic fxn)
		if multiple users neednt access data

	Infeasible:
		in embedded systems when general purpose db may not fit on system storage



Questions
	Handling multiple users accessing data at the same time
		IS this analagous to the locking concepts we used in OS?
		Perhaps it is not, in which case would it follow a pipeline read-after-write dependency model,
		in which the offending read is stalled until the write successfully finishes?
