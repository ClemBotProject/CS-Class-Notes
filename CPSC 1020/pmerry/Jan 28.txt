Doubly linked list assignment - 


List* Newlist from sll_list.h 
	INITIALIZES LIST FOR YOU
	Kinda like a "Constructor" in C++



ON SLL_list.h -> MAKE ALL PROTOTYPES IN C
	THEY ARE SHORT FXNS
	




Singly linked lists - Have a pointer to the NEXT NODE
	No backwards link
	to do a "poprear" you have to start at head and push forward until you have saved the LAST and NEXT TO LAST nodes


Circular linked list
	Head and tail point to each other to "link"
	Doubly linked list

Dummy Node - Always stays and doesnt hold value
	- protects HEAD and TAIL pointer from going null
	

ROW MAJOR VS COLUMN MAJOR
	Row major order - start with row zero and pop colums
		- store the rows together
		IJ calculation -  index = i*rows+j
		

Using Matrix structure with array notation
	a[i][j] is a DOUBLE POINTER
		but you do get ij syntax
		the *a type is holding MORE POINTERS
			must allocate memory for MORE POINTERS
