CPSC 1020 - March 29 2019
when making an object or something simple, use the new operator
	- this will allocate memory
	- it will throw an exception if this is impossible
	
	- can access elements with [] or ptr arithmetic

	- if something is made with new, it should be removed with delete
		- same as malloc() and free()

	- Classes allocate in the constructor
		- delete in the destructor.


	- When is it not possible to use delete??
		- smart pointers
			- a wrapper class that acts like a raw pointer

			- smart pointers automatically deleted dynamic memory

			- DO NOT SUPPORT POINTER ARITHMETIC

			- when assigned to null
				- the assignment operator is overloaded to detect a null assignment
					- deletes when set to null


	If you do a copy constructor
	should do the others
