When controlling the Array indexing within Bubblesort

//array size = SIZE




do...

for(int i = 0; i < (SIZE - 1); i++)
{
	if(elements out of order)
	{
		swap element i and element i+1
		//note dont go past size-1 to protect against seg fault
		//this is sufficient to compare all elements
	}
}

while(madeAswap)

Bubble sort is LINEAR in the best case scenario
		Quadratic in worst case scenario 

Selection sort - Cannot short circuit, must go through a number of iterations

Is it advantageous to make fewer passes through the array
	It depends on the layout of the array - sometimes fewer passes = more array indexes. 

vector v

v.begin = address of first element
v.end = last element PLUS ONE
