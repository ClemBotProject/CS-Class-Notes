CPSC 1020 - Feb 6 2019


The bool data type takes logically true or falso (1 or 0)
	A nonzero number becomes "true"
	a zero number is always "false"
	the Bool data type will return an error if passed incorrect data

	
Cout manipulators 
	The manipulators are GLOBAL - a manip in one loc will change all output from cout - BE EXPLICIT with what you want output to look like

Printf in C++
	in the "cstdio" library
	

===================================================================================================================================================

bool data type defined as integers - represents true or false
	true and false are known to the compiler
	
auto data type
	gives simplest datta type to describe an initialized value

Data type conversion and Typecasting
	operations are performed between same type
		if not the same type, one will be changed to the others data type

Heirarchy of data types
	Highest		long double
			double
			float
			unsigned long long int
			long long int
			unsigned long int
			long int
			unsigned int
	lowest 		int
RANKED BY LARGEST NUMBER THAT THE DATA TYPE CAN HOLD
	use (sizeof) to find the size of the data type

when using the = operator, the expr on the right is converted to the type on the left

FLOATING POINT VALUES  ARE TRUNCATED WHEN ASSIGNED TO INT VARIABLES



CASTING
	c:
		int (variable); //typecast variable to type int

	c++;
		static_cast<type>(variable)



CONSTANTS

	c:
		const int variable = <initialization>;
	c++; 
		#DEFINE <MACRO> <VALUE>
