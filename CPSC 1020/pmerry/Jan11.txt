Areas of Memory, and Types of Variables and Scope



C has
	Built-in data types (char, int, float, double)
	automatic coercion of built-in data types (it forces to data type AFTER calculation)
	bitwise logic and shift operations (& | ~ ^ >> <<)
	single and multi-dimensional arrays 0-origin indexing
	strings formed by array of characters null byte (0) as termination
	dynamically allocated memory provided by library functions (e.g., malloc())

	simpler scope than earlier languages
		no non-local data since function definitions cannot be nested 
		functions can be in separate source files, but can share global variables

	Read the rest on Canvas

 we use compiler

g++ instead of gcc
	-Wall works the same
