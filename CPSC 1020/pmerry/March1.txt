CPSC 1020 - March 1 2019

New MIMIR assignment going up soon
	Notebook program
	Add/subtract sections
		invariants in #sections and width
	Individual assignment





default arguments
	If want to use defualt arguments- LEAVE THE LIKELY DEFUALT PARMS TO THE RIGHT

	
Accessors - functions that ONLY return a value. Make const for readability

Mutator - Can manipulate data in the class

Getters/Setters - Typically only GET or SET a value, they are unprotected and dangerous



With things like a bank account
	floats dont work - the rounding messes things up
	use int - represent as cents - prevents ANY rounding

the endl char flushes the buffer. \n does not
