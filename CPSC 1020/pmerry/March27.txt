CPSC 1020 - March 27 2019

Double Ended Queue
	- Upcoming project, lots of included methods
	
	These are arrays that can hold so many values

	&&variable
		- this is a right hand reference varibale

	Will need to overload the = operator
	
	Use Steve McConnel error codes
		A parameter returns info about performance









Copy Constructors
	Shallow Vs Deep Copy


	

With dynaically allocated class variables and Pointer variables in the class
	every instantiation should have its own memory allocation to prevent dangling pointers
	
	

NumberArray.cpp
	- pages 726-728
	
	Remember- when you dont create a constructor, everything is zero, strings are empty
	In c++98, pointers are initialized to 0 (used for null)
	in c++11, pointers are 



Copy constructor should be passed a reference variable of the same class type

Constructors can call other methods, and private methods 






The following lines are a copy constructor by overloading "="

	NumberArray& operator=(const NumberArray &right); //This is the prototype
	

	//The parameters are on the right hand side of the ooperator, and chooses based on what data types are there

	So in 
	x = y
	x calls the operator
	y is the parameter for the operator
