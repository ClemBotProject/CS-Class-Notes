Linked lists are useful when you dont know the size something in advance
	If you can statically allocate the array, do that instead

FIFO Queue - first in first out
	"Circular Buffer"
	Be Careful with edge effects****



Linked list design choices
	Singly linked - Points to the following element
	doubly linked - points to the following and PREVIOUS elements
	Circularly linked - Last element points to first element
	Dummy head node - head pointer never goes null
	Dummy tail node (if linear, no need if circular)
