REVIEW SESSION ON FRIDAY

Vocab sections - matching section - code segment - short answer


Enumerated data types - Data type created by programmer
	IE in the following data type
		enum Fruit {apple, grape, orange}
			starts with 0-origin indexing
			saves values as INTEGERS indexing by one from the origin
	
	May be able to perform normal integer operations
	
	very convenient in switch statements

	Cant be used with input statements, such as cin

	

c - call by reference
=================================
void swap(int *a, int *b){
	int temp = *a;
	*a = *b;
	*b = temp;
}

Normal swap statement with call by reference





c++ - call by reference
====================================
void swap(int &a, int &b){
	int temp = a;
	a = b; 
	b = temp;
}

-the ampersand notes these as REFERENCE VARIABLES
	a reference variable is automatically dereferenced

use void functions when you have an object you wish to change but not pass back




Using files for data storage
	By creating a file to write data to, it can be saved between runs of programs
	Text File - contains test with letters, digits, and punctuation. Can be viewed w/ notepad

	Binary file- contains 0 or one and not encoded as text. Cant be viewed with a text editor


	Sequential access goes in order of the file
	Random (direct) access will retrieve any data directly.


	ifsteam -> means input file stream
		inFile.open("inventory.dat"); <- makes it easy using the open member function
	
	same with
		outFile.open("file.txt.");




	Read/Write with the insertion/extraction operators

	CLOSE YOUR FILES - can create memory leaks - kinda like memory allocation

	when the stream extraction fails, this can be used to evaluate false on an EOF controlled loop

	File handle - true when open successfully, false otherwise
