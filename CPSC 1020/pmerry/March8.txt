Initialization 

int length = 12; //this works

int length(12); //this works but looks like a fxn call

int length{12}; //this works and is unambiguous


Range based for loops
	- DOES NOT GIVE ACCESS TO THE SUBSCRIPTS
	
	-to "pull out" the index, must use the classic for loop



Array comparison
	the == operator DOES NOT WORK
		The variable names decay to ptrs, so the ptrs arent the same 

Loop conditions are evaluated from LEFT TO RIGHT
	In an AND statement - the loop stops at the first false
	in an OR  statement - the loop stops at the first true
