AWS well architected framework

pillars of cloud creation
	perform operations as code
	annotate documentation
	make small, reversible, frequent changes
	refine operations procedures frequently
	anticipate failure
	learn fron operational events and failures


Security pillar
	protecc info, sys, assets while delivering business value through risk assessment

	implement security foundation
	tracability
	apply security at ALL layers
	automate security best practices
	protect data in transit and at rest
	keep people from data
	prepare for security events


Reliability piller
	focus
		prevent and recov er from failuyre to meet tdemand
	
	topics
		setting up
		cross project requirements
		recovery handling
		handling change
	
Performance efficiency
	focus
		use IT and compute resources efficientrly to meet reqs and maintain efficiency as demand changes
		and tech evolves
	Key topics
		selecting resource types and sizes based on workload reqs
		monitoring performance
		making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as a business evolves

	democratize advanced technologies -
	go global in minutes
	use serverless architectures
	experiment more often
	have mechanicaly sympathy


Cost optimization
	Focus
		run systems to deliver perf at lowest cost possible
	Key topics
		understanding and controlling when money is being spent
		selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types
		analyzing spending over time
		sccaling to meet business needs without overspending


Reliability & availability
	reliability - the probability that a system will perform its intended function without failure
		MTBF = mean time between failures = total time in service/#failures
		MTTF = mean time to failures
		MTTR = mean time to repair


	availability - measure of percentage of time resources are operating normally
		normal operation time/total time

High availibility
	sys can withstand some degradation while still being available
	downtime minimized
	minimal human intervention needed
