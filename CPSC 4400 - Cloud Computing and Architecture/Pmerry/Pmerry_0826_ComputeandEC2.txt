section 2
	EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
		Provides Virtual Machines in the cloud
		Get full control of guest OS (win/linux) on each instance

	can launch instances of any size into any availability zone anywhere in the world
		Launchg instances from Amazon Machine Images
		Launch instances with a few clicks and ready in mins
	controll traffic to and from instances

	Step one - select AMI - Amazon machine image
	Step 2 - select an instance type (type of machine to run on)
		This includes networking features
			To maximizze networking and bandwidth performance of your instance type
				if you have interdependent instances, launch them into a cluster placement group

	step 3 - Specify network settings 
		where to deploy
		identify the VPC and optionally the subnet
		Should a public IP be automatically assigned
			make it internet accessible

	Step 4 - Attach Identity/access management roles (optional)

	Step 5 -User data Script
		Optionally provide a user data script at instance launch

		Use User data scripts to customize the instance

		Can be used strategically, 
			IE reduce number of custom AMIs to build and maintain

	Step 6 - Specify storage
		Config root volume
			this is where guest OS is installed

		Attach storage volumes (optional)

		for each volume, specify
				size of disk
				volume type
				if vol is deleteed when instance tedrminates
				if encryption should be used		

	Step 7 - add tages
		instance metadata
		basically for resource inventory, owners, etc 

	Step 8 - security groups
		virtual firewall for instance
			exists OUTSIDE the instance's guest OS
				this allows grouping EC2 instances in one firewall

		create rules that specify source and the acceptable ports/protocols to use

	step 9 - identify/create the key pair
		Key pair 
			a public key that AWS stores
			a private key file that you will store

	
EC2 instances can be made programmatically
	

Elastic IP Address
	Rebooting an instance will not change any IP addr or DNS Hostname

	When an instance is stopped and restartedd
		Public IPv4 and external DNS hostname will change 

	if you require a persistent IP addr,
		associate the IP with an elastic...

Amazon Cloudwatch
	watch EC2 instances in real time

	Can raise alarms of EC2 instances

	


	
EC2 storage options
	Elastic block storage 
		durable block level storage
		data is persistent

	Instance store/ephemeral storage
		if the instance stops, data is deleted
