Amazon Relational Database Service
	

Unmanaged vs Managed services
	Unmanaged: Scaling, fault tolerance, and availability are managed by YOU
	managed: The above are built into the service

Relational databases need
	server maintenance and energy footprint
	software installation and patches
	backups and availability
	limiting scalability/enabling sclability
	security
	OS install and patches

	On premises vs RDS

In Managed, you manage
	Application optimization

	AWS manages
		everything listed above

Amazon RDS Can run in a virtual private cloud
	it would be in the private subnet layer of the VPC


Amaon RDS read replicas
	use dupe db to parallelize reads

	also offers async replication
	can be promoted to master if needed

	Functionality
		use for read heavy db workloads
		offload read queries
 
Use cases
	Web and mobile apps
		high throughput
		massive storage
		high availability
	Ecommerce	
		low cost DB
		data security
		fully managed

	Mobile/online games
		rapidly grow capacity
		auto scaling
		DB monitoring

When to use RDS
	 complex transactions and queries
	 med/high query or write rate. 30k iops (15k read and write)
	no more than aa single worker node or shard
	durable


Dont use RDS when you need
	MASSIVE read write rates
	Sharding due to ...
