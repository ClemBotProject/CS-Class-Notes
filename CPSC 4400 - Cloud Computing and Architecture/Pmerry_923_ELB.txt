Automatic Scaling and Monitoring ACF
	
Elastic load balancing
	Dist incoming app or network traffic across multiple targets in a 1 or more AZs
	
	Scale load balancer as traffic to application changes over time

Load balancers
	App load balancer
		load balancing of HTTP(S) traffic
		routes traffic to targets on content of req
		
	Network load balancer 
		Load balance TCP/UDP/TLS traffic when need extremem performance
	Classic Load Balancer (prev gen)
		Load ballance, HTTP(S), TCP, and SSL traffic
		across EC2 instances


Elasticv load balancing
	With app load balancers and network load balancers, you register targets in target groups, and route traffic to target groups
	classic load balances you register inscances with load balancer


Cloudwatch
	allows sstats on configured settings
	allows alarms if a metric exceeds allowable range - Good for Denial of Service/DDoS attacks?

Access logs
	Cloudwatch captures detailed info about reqs to load balancer

Cloudtrail logs
	capture the who what when where of API interactions in AWS services

ELB focuses on HTTP and HTTPS load balancing


Cloudwatch
	monitors
		AWS resources
		Apps on AWS
	Collects and tracks
		standard metrics
		custom metrics
	Alarms
		Send noticfications to an amazon SNS topic
		perform EC2 auto scaling or EC2 actions
	Events
		Define rules to match changes in AWS env and route events to one or more target functions 
			or streams for processing
Fast scale up
Slow scale down

Scaling enables response to network needs
Amazon EC2 auto scaling maintains application availability by automaticallyadding/removing ec2 instances
