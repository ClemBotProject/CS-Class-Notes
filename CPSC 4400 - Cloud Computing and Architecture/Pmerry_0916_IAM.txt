Amazon identity and access management
	Use IAM to manage access to AWS resources
		a resource is an entity in an aws acct you can work with
		EX, an ec2 instance or s3 buckey

	Define fine grained access rights
		who can access what
		which resources can be accessed and what the user can do to teh resource
		How resources can be accesed

	IAM is a no cost AWS acct feature


IAM: essential components
	person - person or app tat can authenricate with AWS acct
	users/group - a collection of IAM users with identical authorizaiton
	policy - The document defining which resources can be accesseed and the level of access to each resource
	roles - useful mechanism to grant permissions for aws service requests


Authenticate as IAM user to gain access

When you define an IAM user, you select the type of access the user is permitted to use
	programmatic access
		authenticate using
			Access key id
			secret access key
		provides AWS CLI and AWS SDK access
	
	AWS Management Console
		Authenticate using
			12 digit Account ID or alias
			IAM username
			IAM password
	if enabled, multi-factor authentication prompts an authentication code


Authorization: What is permitted
	All permissions denied by default
	explicit denial of privelege disallows that over any allow statements
	Best practice: follow principle of least privelege

IAM Policies
	statments as JSON docs
	Two types of policies
		group or user

	MADE UP OF
		effect,
		action
		resource


	There are 3 states you can have
		Explicit Allow
		Explicit Deny
		Implicit Deny

IAM GROUPS
	collection of IAM users
	A group is used to grant the same permissions to multiple users
		permissions grated by attaching IAM policy or policies to the group

	A user can be in multiple groups
	no default group
	GROUPS CANNOT BE NESTED
