Amazon VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

Virtual Private Cloud
	VPC Is a foundational service
	provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define
	Givese control of virtual networking resources
		select IP range
		creation of subnets
		configure route table and network gateways
	Enables customizing network config for VPC
	Enables one to use multiple layers of security

	VPCs can span availability zones

	VPCs 
		logically isolated from other VPCs
		dedicated to AWS acct
		Belong to a single AWS region and can span availability zones

	Sub nets
		Range of IP that divide a VPC
		belong to  a single availability zone
		classified as public or private

	
	Proper subnetting allows fine grain access protections
	
	DEFENSE IN DEPTH STRATEGY FOR SECURITY


CIDR notation
	the /24 means
		first 3 octets (24 bits) are "locked" or not available for addresses

		so you have 8 bits to make an address basically

	Alternatively, /16
		first 16 bits locked
		increases addr space from 256 to 65536

Route tables control traffic for subnet
route tables have built in local route
You add additional routes to the table
the local route cannot be deleted


Internet Gateway
	Public subnet
		allows public traffic ingress
	Private subnet
		no direct connection with public internet

	Principle - minimize publicly available info

	THERE IS ONE INTERNET GATEWAY PER VPC


	route table
		any traffic to the internet should go through the internet gateway UNLESS
		useing 10.0, then dont go to internet - go to our route table to find the device

VPC endpoints

A VPC IS JUST AN ADDRESS SPACE


Security Groups
	read up on this
	
	Sec Group Vs network ACLs
			sec group	- Network ACLs
		scope - instance level 	- subnet level
		Rules -	...


Build security into VPC architecture
	isolate subnets if possible
	choose the appropriat5e gateway device or VPN connection for your needs
	Use firewalls

Security groups and network ACLs are firewall options that you can use to secure your VPC
