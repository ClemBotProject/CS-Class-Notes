Intro To Cloud Computing 

Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of computing power,database, storage, apps, or other IT devices via the internet with pay as you go pricing
	Changes infrastructure scope from hardware to software

	in Cloud computing, resources can be reallocated as needed

	Sofware solutions are
		flexible
		change more easily and cost effectively
		eliminate the undifferentiated heavy lifting tasks

	Cloud deployment models
		Cloud native - everything in the cloud
		Hybrid - Partially in the cloud, with some physical applications
		Onn-premises/traditional datacenter - a datacenter virtualized to better utilize the datacenter

	Slide 12 - graphic showing the mapping from traditional IT concepts to AWS concepts

	Three Cloud Service models
		Infrastructure as a service (more control for IT)
		Platform (?) as a service
		Software as a Service (less control for IT)

	Almost all IT can be used with an AWS cloud computing service

Section 2
	Trade captital expense for variable expense
	benefit from massive economies of scale
	stop guessing capacity
	increase speed and agility
	stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	go global in minutes


Section 3
	Web services
		software that makes itself available over a network
		uses a standard format for request and response of the API

	AWS
		AWS is a secure cloud platfrom with many global cloud based products
		AWS provides on demand access to compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources and management tools
		You only pay for services you use
		AWS services work together like building blocks

	AWS is a secure cloud platform with interplay between many services
	Choose service based on business goals and tech requirements
	
	There are 3 ways to interact with AWS
		Command Line
		from the website
		from an SDK
