Office Hours
	Prof: Thurs 1:00 - 2:00
	TA (Anvrata): Wed 11:00-Noon 221 McAdams

There is a review page on the website 
	It chronicles the topics week by week with the scope of exams listed as well


Data comm 101
	Wrapup
		The comm channel along with modulation technique determines the bandwidth
			Channel Bandwidth: Measured cycles per second (hertz), is the fastest CONTINOUSLY oscillating signal that can be sent over the channel
				Also refers to bandwidth as width of the spectrum available to the signal
				
				A transmitters max signal rate (baud rate) is limited by the channel bandwidth.

		The FCC has divided the wireless spectrum into bands
			Wifi has multiple bands of the wireless spectrum (2.5GHz, 5Ghz)
			Cell phones have around 600MHz to 60GHz

		Therefore channel bandwidth refers to the portion of the spectrum being used on that physical media
		With ethernet/CoAx - the whole spectrum gets used thus more data transfer 


	Max data rate over a channel
		

	D=2B Log_2(K)			: NOTE: this assumes no noise on a channel, therefore max data rate
	
		D = max data rate over a channel (measured in MegaBits per second, but the line is fuzzy)
		B = Channel bandwidth
		K = The number of signal levels available
			Ethernet has 64 qam, 256 qam
				qam = Quadrature Amplitude modulation, but the important part is that the 
					qam deals with rate of oscillation between 0 and 1 

Data Comm 102
	Data is divided into packets, computers take turns sending packets over a packet switched network

	A packet is referred to as a fram once it 'hits' the wire

	there are a few times that are significant
		T0 - where the first bit of the frame is sent
		T1 - where the last bit of the fram is sent
		T0' - where the first bit of the frame is recieved
		T1' - where the last bit of the fram is recieved

	Ideally,
		T1 - T0 = T1' - T0'

	T1' - T1 = the time it takes for the information to travel from host to reciever
			the upper bound is the speed of light
			the medium can slow or speed this up 

	Bit errors
		A transmitter must use specific power and modulation parameters,
			to correct for bit errors
		the transmission propagates over medium does add background noise, the reciever must differentitate between the transmission signal and noise
		
		Errors must be detected and recovered
			Error Detection: Methods such as a checksum as a mathematic signature of src data
				The sender computes sending CRC = f(message) and adds to the frame
				the reciever computes recieved CRC = f(message) (this detects for errors at every layer or hop)
				no error if these are the same
		
		Error Recovery
			Sliding window error recovery
				Go-Back-N: can send a window of N packets before stalling. Acks from the reciever clock out new packets at the sender
				If a packet is deopped, a timeout at the sender forces a retransmit of the entire window

			Forward error correction (FEC), also called coding - A cetain amt of redundant info is sent with each frame, the strength of coding should match channel conditions

	Network Congestion
		A sender that sends VERY fast that has a reciever reading at a slower rate
			The data will stack up in "buffers" (there are a lot in the path)
			its possible to overflow (feasibly) in which packets are dropped or pushed out


		
		

	Ethernet Frame Format (prod by link layer)
		Preamble (7) | Src Addr (6) | Dest Addr (6) | Length(2) ||| DSAP (1) | SSAP (1) | cntl (1) | code (3) | Type (2)||| Data (38 - 1492) | CRC (4)
					MAC HEADER			 |			802.2 header			 |	Data: IP, ARP, SNA

	Length: total num bytes in the frame
	DSAP, SSAP, cntl, code, type - how to pass information through stack (check that fact)
