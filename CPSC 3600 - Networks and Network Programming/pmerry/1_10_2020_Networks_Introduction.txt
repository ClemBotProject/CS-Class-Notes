CPSC 3220 - Networks and Network Programming


Intro to Distributed Systems
	Network Definitions
		Host - A computer that connects to a network
		Client-Server Applications - Applications online that a computer may access
		
			Browser -> Host -> Network -> Website
			|	   |	     | 		^The website will also retain a networking stack, but the presentation/session layers will be seperated (got rolled into application layer)
			|	   |	     |			This stack will contain Application | Transport | Network - link - physical
			|	   |	     |
			|	   |	     ^Protocols - the rules by which two hosts will communicate/participate
			|	   |
			|	   ^Has a Networking Stack - usually a 7 layered : Application | Presentation | Session | Transport | Network | Link | Physical
			|	   |	One of the design goals is to architect the web app to fit this model
			|	   |	Primary interface - called Sockets
			|	   ^ Host implies a networking stack is used (though different types of networks exist)
			|
			^Intuitive, such as google chrome


	Network stack AS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERNET
		Application	|
		Transport	| <- Considered a part of TCP-IP
		Network 	|
		Link		    | TCP-IP is supposed to work over any link type
		Physicial

	Why concern with network stack
			note each stack layer has its own header
		The application layer on one host will communicate with the application layer on the other host
			The logic follows for all layers

		End to End - the computing done on that stack layer is fully contained, and only is done on end points (between the accessing and serving computers)
			IE this just means it doesnt go anywhere but its source and destination

Conceptualization of Distributed Systems with the Postal System

	Jim's	------> Local PO ------> Regional PO(s) --> local Po --------> 	Dan's
	Home 	------>								Home
	

	What does the letter have
		The name of the recipient
			The street, city, state, zip address (destination Address)
		Return address
			ditto (source address)
		Contents
			Note the contents is irrelevant to the delivery process
			(package delivers the same as letter for example)

	Suppose the letter being sent is the application and the recipient is the peer application
		The data will be placed into one or more 'Packets' - This is called an IP Datagram
		IP Datagram format defined by TCP-IP (the protocol is called IP - internet protocol)
			IP Datagram
				IP Header -> contained within -> source address (IP addr, port #), destination address (IP addr, port #)
				---------
				transport 
				---------
				Data

	The post offices in the example correspond to Routers in the network
	The name on a letter corresponds to where in the destination the packet will be delivered
		IE ensure mail goes to you not your children
		In the real sense, this ensures the correct application recieves the info

Misc info about IP addresses
	8.8.8.8
	9.9.9.9
	192.156.0.1
	etc

	a 32 bit number
	each number represents the octet, seperated by periods/decimals
	there are 4 octets

	IP contains 2 pieces of information
		<zip code , streed addr> :: <network ID, Host ID> 

Intro to VMs
	Information is online on the website

	a VM gives a sandbox to work in
		we will be using ubuntu 16.4 with root access
	
	Host OS - the os on your machine
	Virtual box - the virtual machine manager, allows creation of virtual machines which are essentially a new machine
		Sometimes a VM is called a Guest OS
