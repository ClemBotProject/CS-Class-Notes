There is a pingpdf matlab/octave file that will take a single data file command line argument
	this is meant to plot the round trip ping if i am not mistaken

DATA COMM 101

	How do computers  really communicate
		there must be a connection (wireless counts as physical connection)
			The transferr medium makes a difference
				copper: twisted pair
				Glass: optical -> highest capabilities as a transfer medium
				Air: radio (many portions of frequency spectrum can be used, think 2.4 or 5 GHz)
		Data is encoded and transmitted as energy
		Energy is decoded at the destination back into data
		each form of energy has different properties and requirements for transition 

	
	The physical layer encodes the binary 1's and 0s into changes in the energy (or signal) to be sent via the physical medium
		The destination device will decode based on standards for communication 

	

	Data communications
		simplest approach - use varying voltages to rep a 0 or a 1
		one common encoding uses negative voltage for 1 and positive for 0
		In following figure, transmitter puts voltage on line for 0 and negative on the line for 1 

		more sophisticated schemes will use a carrier signal to help propagate the energy further

		Modulation - encoding data on a signal

	Multiplexing
		Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) achieves multiplexing by using different carrier frequencies
		allows mulitple sources to simultaneously share a medium without interference

	Noise in the wire leads to bit errors
		bit errors can lead to packet loss

	Physical layer can be destroyed
		the higher layers should handle this for us



UNIX 101
	the command 'ps' shows active processes
		with no parameters, it shows only that related to the current shell

	for processes concerned with your user ID
		ps aux | grep <username>
		       ^ piping the standard out of this program to the grep program
			when there is at least one pipe symbol the whole command is called "A pipeline"
