Practice question number 28 - it was ambiguous 
	the answer intended was: tokenizing/parsing
Practice question number 35
	answer - encodes, energy,  propagate
 


NMCLI = network manager client interface 
	

Some Section 2 information - there will be 2 questions from here (one is based on stuff like RTT, one is based on classful IP)
	Know how to calculate throughput and transfer rate 

	Question 2.3 
		Step 1 - draw a diagram of the specified interaction 

		Consider sending a 1056 byte frame over a linke with rate 10MBPS. the propagation delay over link 1 is 1 ms and over link 2 is 10 ms
			Multiply num bytes to send by 8 - we need bits
			Convert 10MBPS to bytes per second
			propagation delay + Num bytes to send / bits/sec = send time over link 1
			send time over link 1  + send time over link 2 (calc similarly) = total time from host to client

			

Stop and wait protocol
	You send a datagram, and wait to receive one back before continuing execution.
