	Questions will come from Homework and Excercises

Ping 
	A standard internet construct

	Example Use
		ping -c 4 ada8.computing.clemson.edu
			parms:
				-c = count
				4  = number of count iterations
				ada8... = the host to ping to 

		Actions:
			does a send, recieve, sleep, repeat
				a send corresponds to a send over a socket	
					causes stack to make a datagram
						it sends the data at T0
			there is a reciever (server), who recieves the datagram
				it recieves the datagram at T1

			then there is a sleep - this is a parameter that you can specify the sleep
				default = 1 second 

			THUS: the ping time is the T1 value minus the T2 value
				will typically be on order of milliseconds
				represents the RTT (Round Trip Time) RTT = T1 - T0
				and will tell the average RTT
				and will tell the average Loss Rate over the session


			Dealing with packet loss
				Packet loss is implied always

				Alarm - an OS provided service
					A process registers saying I want to catch alarm by passing pointer to alarm handler
				
	
	
	conceptually simple - 



Unix 101
	Unix has 2 timers 
		Real Time Clock 
			- keeps track of time when off but not when sys is running
			- drifts from real time based on tickrate
			- its purpose is not for high precision timing
		System Clock
			- software based counter based on timer interrupt
			- only runs when system is on (gets initialized at REAL TIME CLOCK
			- references to the clock in ntpd mean the system clock
		TSC - is a hardware counter that is being clocked by a precision clocking function
			- this is the clock for the cpu (and is very fast)
			- also the clock tick powering the CPU
			- linux builds high res timers off that clock

	the equivalent to getcurrenttime is clock_gettime with the flag/parameter CLOCK_REALTIME

		Note on CLOCK_MONOTONIC 	
			ensures the clock is never set backwards 
			may have skips forward
		Note on CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
			provides access to raw hardware based time not subject to adjustments performed by adjtime
			USE THIS ONE
	Process Creation
		Fork()
			a parent process forks a child process
				return vals
					0 - this is the context of the child process
					GT 0 - this is the context of the parent process
					LT 1 - this is a failure 
			exec syscall after a fork to replace a processes memory space with a new program 
				everything gets COPIED to the child process
				it is a deep copy in that everything gets re-allocated
				the child will have a seperate address space that is seeded from the address space of the parent
			When a child terminates, there is an interaction between the parent and the system
				the OS should provide a way to tell parent when child has terminated
