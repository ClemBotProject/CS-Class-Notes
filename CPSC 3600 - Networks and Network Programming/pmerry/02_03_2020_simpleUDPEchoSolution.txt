Office Hours - Remember theyre on thursday
Test on Monday 2/10 ( a week from today )
	Review files online

He starts class showing us an example about how 'getaddrinfo" on google will produce multiple IPv4 addresses
	This is because google has multiple servers it can use
		How do you decide which to use?
			simpleUDPEcho would pick the first produced

	
Host/dig -> similar to 'getaddrinfo'
	IE 
		host -t any <domain name>

	

getaddrinfo - a fairly new call, youll be likely to see the older version
	"gethostbyname" -> This is tied to IPv4, does not produce IPv6 addresses
		the reason we use getaddrinfo now is because of the interoperability between v4 or v6

	
One way delay time
	Send the "send time" with the datagram
	when recieving, subtract the send time from the time recieved
	

From the simpleUDPEchoSolution
	The hardest part has to do with placing the sequence number and timestamp into the message
	
	From the POV of the client
		Malloc 2 buffers (suppos 1k bytes)
			Tx Buffer
			Rx Buffer
		while( loopflag ) 
		{
			obtain time stamp one( ts1 = gettimestampD())	//use high precision timestamps, IE use CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
			messagetime = getcurTime(myTimeVal)		//the mytimeval struct will be of type "timespec" -> which has a seconds and nanoseconds field
			Update the header
				this makes sure the first field is written to Tx buffer followed by the second field immediately after
				Now the time stamp of sending is in the header of the packet
			-sendto(addr, txbuff, messagesize)
			-recvfrom(addr, rxbuff, messagesize)
			obtain time stamp 2  (ts2 = gettimestampD())	//use high precision timestamps
			RTTSample  = ts2 - ts1;
		}

	There are two values
		txintptr = points to the top of txBuff
			this allows us to treat the first few positions in the buffer as positions in an int array
