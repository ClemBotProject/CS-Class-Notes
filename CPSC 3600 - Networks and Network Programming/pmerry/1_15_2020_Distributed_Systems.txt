Git and GitHub intro
	
	Very helpful for version control. 

	Short list of git commands
		
		git clone repo (a url)
		git pull //updates your locac repository
		git status //see what changed
		git diff // find differences
		git log  // showw commit history
		to undo things
			git undo
			git revert
		theres a lot more too


	commands to save local work but need latest repo updates
		git stash
		git stash list //tp see stash
		git pull
		git stash pop


Introduction to Distributed Systems
	Distributed system - a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system

	
	Concept			|	Ex
	Centralized Services	|	A single server for all users
	Centralized data	| 	a single online telephone book
	centralized algs	| 	doing routine computing on data


	Machine A	|	Machine B	|	Machine C
	-----------------Distributed Applications---------------------------
	-------------------MiddleWare Services------------------------------
	Local OS	|	Local OS	| 	Local OS

	Distributed computing is computing performed in a distributed system
		Dist programmign is either middleware software or the application software

	Network programming is a building block of a dist sys


	Message Passing
		A process sends a message representing a request or an event indication. The reciever processes the request and sends a message in response
		A broker recieves messages and then passes it to interested parties (it looks a little bit like the callback method pattern)

	Client-Server
		Involves asymmetric roles between two collaborating processes. One process, the server, is a service provider. 
		The client issues a request and waits for a response

	Peer-to-Peer
		involves equal roles between multiple processes. Each peer has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities 

		If its difficult to designate a "server" device, we allow the network of devices to pass around server roles	
			The information could then be distributed across a number of different nodes 
				HE gave the exaple of bit-Torrent and their p2p 
					it made it possible avoid the large datacenter
					it made it impossible to track who was storing all the data
	Communication Facilities:
		must hide the low level message passing through the network from the upper layers
			the layers refer to the stack model from prev lecture.

	Naming: 
		Must provide a global, scalable name discovery and identification mechanism

	Synchronization: 
		Must provide services to allow participating entities to synchronize clocks and data access

	Consistency and Replication:
		replication is required for performance and reliability. A DS must ensure distributed data is consistent throughout the system

	Fault tolerance:
		Future of DS's will be self managing and self healing (autonomous computing)
	
	Security:
		Essential to any DS
