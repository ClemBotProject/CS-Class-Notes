# CS-Class-Notes
A public repo for the storing of classes and teachers notes 


Contribution steps

1 - If you can find the directory related to your class, ignore this step!
	Create a directory for your class in the following form

	CPSC XXXX - <CLASS NAME>

	note the "- <CLASS NAME> is optional

2 - within this directory, create a folder with your username.

3 - place ALL your notes the folder you made in step 2. They do not need your name in the title
	(though that is nice), but it should be named in such a way that 
	
	a - one can order your notes chronologically
	or
	b - you can search the notes by topic

	thus the following two examples should be used when naming files

	Usr_<DateNotesTaken>.txt or .pdf

	Usr_<TopicOfNotes>.txt or .pdf
 
4 (Optional) Place your readme in the directory with your notes

5 - make a pull request against the original repo so that your notes can be brought in and shared
	with your classmates.

WHAT NOT TO ADD

1 - Code related to your school projects

2 - Test Questions before the test is graded and returned by your professor

3 - Any resources your professors post, provided they did not provide permission to post it 

4 - Any test or quiz keys. This includes spreadsheets or tools that can complete homework autonomously
	(E.G. You cannot post a program or spreadsheet to solve your physics homework, 
		shows the work for converting to a different base, etc.)

5 - Starter Code. Because different professors may differ in their offering of starter code
	for a similar or identical project, it cannot be posted here.

6 - As a general rule, if you must question the ethics/honesty implications of uploading something,
	it is safer to opt not to upload.
