Memory on the Datapath
	
	you have a pipe of mem - with seperate for IF and MEM

	well over 100* for mem access than CPU clock cyc

	Mem accesses to DRAM are costly
		Now its close to 30 nanosec for DRAM access


	Mem prioiritized size over speed

	

How to create small but fast mem

	This is Cache Memory

Principle of locality
	PRogram access small portions of address space at a time

	Temporal and spatial locality
		lookups in time likely to be looked up soon again
		lookups will probably look up nearby locs next


RAM integrated circuits
	Static - info stored in latches
	dynamic - info stored as charges on capacitors


SRAM uses logic gates to maintain value (and takes more)

DRAM
	Stor info on capacitors
	Cheaper larger capacity

	Slower than setting a latch
