Theorem:
	If there is an infinite distinguishable string, then the langauge is not regular 

	
Theorem restated:
	Each distinguishable string needs a different state in the DFA



"Spirit of the class algorithm"
	You need to do a recursive algorithm where you start on the "outside" of the
	RE and then peel away the outside until you have nothing remaining
