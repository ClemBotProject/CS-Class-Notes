CPSC 3500 - 01_13_2020

Real Exressions 
	Example of an RE: 
		(2+(11)*)0
		
	Facts about Regular Expressions
		3 operations
			+ is OR
			* is star operation - arbitrarily many repeats and BY DEFINITION includes possibility of none
			no operator (operands next to each other) = concatenation

	By these rules, the RE above in the example produces
		20 OR 110 OR 11110 OR 0 (note does not include 1120 - the * is not on the or between 2 and 11)
