Kleene's Theorem:
	If there is a Finite Automaton for a language then you can build a real expression for the language
		AND vice versa

		Such a language is called regular


	Significance:
		Doesnt just prove equivilance, there are means to convert between FA and RE (both ways as well)



Non-deterministic Finite Automata:
	Example:
		      0	     0         
		| A | -> |B| -> || C || <- 0 , 1
		^0,1

	Language:
		All Strings containing double 0

	Significance:
		Notice State A has two 0 transitions
			Nondeterministic therefore ambiguous
		
		Notice State B has no 1 transition

	
	Features:
		If no legal transition, the machine dies
 	
		How would you handle transitioning from state A with a 0
			Nondeterministic FA accepts a string IF and ONLY IF it is possible to end in an accept state 

			Meaning of all choices you have, you can reach the accept state at the end of the string
		
			How does the FA know what transitions to take
				the machine is "smart" in that if there are two paths, it can "process" both and pick appropriate solutions
