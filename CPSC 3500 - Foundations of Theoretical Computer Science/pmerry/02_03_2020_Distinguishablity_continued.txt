Recall: Distinguishability
	Strings x & y are distinguishable with respect to language L if 
		there exists a string z such that exactly one of xz, yz are in L.

	Otherwise the strings x and y are indistinguishable

	


	Example: L is set of all binary strings with exactly 2 0's 
		

	Any deterministic FA for a langauge L has to have at least four states 
		Note this is "any DFA must have n states" is dependent on the criteria of the langauge described by the DA 



Example: Give 3 distinguishable and 3 indistinguishable for 
	1) odd 0s and odd 1s
		Dist:
			empty string
			0
			1
		InDist: (simply write down a string and pick others that behave the same)
			empty string
			0011
			11
	2) palindromes
		Dist:
			empty string
			0
			1
		Indist:
			Every pair of strings are distinguishable (may be false)
	3) ends in a 0 
		Dist:
			0
			1
			
		Indist:
			00
			000
			0000
