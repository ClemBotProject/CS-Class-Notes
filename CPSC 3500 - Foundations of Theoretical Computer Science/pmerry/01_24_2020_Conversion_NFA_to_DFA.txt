Kleene's Theorem
	Recall
		All languages have a
			DFA	- deterministic finite automaton
			NFA	- nondeterministic finite automaton
 			and an RE


Convertingt NFA to DFA
	in simulation of NFA, we need only remember the set of states it could be in

	The finite automaton uses their state as memory
		therefore you build a finite automoton that remembers a set of states

	
	You build the table in the handout
		then any states in the DFA that could possibly end 
		up in your NFA's accept states will be an accept state
