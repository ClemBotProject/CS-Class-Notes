CPSC 3500 - Computer Science Theory
First Quiz Monday
	All assesments draw from the same selection of questions - IE study from practices and homework
	Revision Questions Tab on website has old test questions

State "remembering" - when the state has a transition that doubles back (a trap)
	

(continued example)
C) accept binary strings of exactly one 0 (if a path doesnt lead out, its a trap)

-> A -0-> |B| -0-> C 
	
D) accept binary strings not containing a 0

-> |A| -0-> B

E) Not exactly one 0 

	note - this is a compliment of C
		How do you use the compliment of a FA?
		 We would swap the accept/reject cases from C (or any complimentary FA)
		 Where it said yes, it will now say no
		 Where it said no, it will now say yes
			This holds because (in this example), the one case 
			you would except will now be rejected

	Second method of handling NOT cases
		if you cannot interchange accept/reject
		rewrite the statement without using negatives
			IE accept exacly no 0s or 2 or more 0s


Tricks - think about processing the string yourself, what is absolutely essential to remember?
	The FA should resemble these properties

Deterministic Finite Automata - MUST have for every state and possible character, a transition


Theory of Finite Automata
	input tape 0 contains a single string

	head - reads input string one symbol at a time

	memory - in one finite number of states (the FA can only retain current state)
	

	Terminlogy
		Alphabet (capital sigma) - is the set of symbols
	
		language is a set of strings
			unary language means alphabet contains exactly one char

		length - number of symbols in a string


	Building FA - Recent memory
		Accept Strings ending with 00
			(incomplete)
			-> A - 0 - > B - 0 -> |C|...
			   A < - 1 - B
