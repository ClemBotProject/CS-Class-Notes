Application software 
	Written in HLL

System Software
	Compiler: translates HLL code to machine code

	Operating System: service code
		handling IO
		managing mem and storage
		scheduling tasks/resources
------------------------------------------------------
Hardware
	Processor, memory, I/O controllers

Software includes
	Applications
	OS
	Compiler
	Assembler

<dividing line is considered the instruction set architecture>

Hardware includes
	Processor | Memory | IO system
		Datapath Control
		digital design (essentially a collection of circuit design)
		circuit design
		transistors (works like switch)


Individual syntax elements are called tokens

Performance
	Algorithm
		Performance determines the number of ops used

	Programming language, compiler, architecture
		determine number of machine instructions executed per operation

	Processor and memory system
		determine how fast instructions are executed

	IO system (Including OS)
		determines how fast IO operations are executed


Machine structures from programmer view
	What programmer writes
	how it is converted to something the computer understands
	how the computer interprets the program
	what makes programs slow


Programming optimization methods
	Design for moores law
	use abstraction to simplify design
	make the common case fast
	performance via parallelism, pipelining, and prediction
		parallelism - use multiple parts in parallel to complete tasks faster
		pipelining  - steps are broken into substeps to be solved in sequence
				once the first substep in an operation is finished, begin the next operation (overlapping operation execution)
		prediction  - predicting what to load next in branching code (ifs, fors, whiles)
	Heirarchy of memories
		faster & smaller
		slower & larger
	Dependability via redundancy
		multiple components to handle failure, etc
		IE RAID disk storage


Moore's Law
	2x transistors per chip every 1.5 years
