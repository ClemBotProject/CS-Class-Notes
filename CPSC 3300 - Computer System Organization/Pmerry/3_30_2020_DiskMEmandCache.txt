Memory Heirarchy
	
	Two l1 caches - one for instr and one for daya

	As level of cache increases, size increases while speed decreases
		l1 is only around 32-64 KB
			will be accessed freq because of locality

HDD Storage
	nonvolatile
	HAve cylinder of concentric disks, concentric tracks on a disk, and a sector making up some arc of a track


	Sectors have sector ID
		data - 512 bytes. 4096 bytes(adv form)

		Error correcting code
			USe to hide defects and record errors

	
	Access to sector involves
		queue delay if other accesses pending
		seek to move the read/write head
		rotational latency
		Data Transfer
		Controller Overhead

	Disk granularity is a sector


Locality on hdd

	memory heirarchy

	Store everything on disk

	copy recently accessed mem items from disk to smaller dram mem
		main mem

	copy more recently accessed items from dram to smaller sram
		cacher mem attached to CPU core (Avoids the BUS)




Memory Heirarcy levels

	Block
		unit of copying, may be multiple (usually multiple) words

	If accessedf data is present in upper level
		hit - access satisfied by upper level
		hit ratio - hit/accesses

	If access is absent
		miss - block copied from lower level
`		time taken: miss penalty
		miss ratio: miss/accesses

	Stride size of 64 bytes, new block gets transferred every time (cache miss every time)


How to tell if data is available in mem
	need to map memory to cache
	each loc in mem correspondes to a loc in cache with a hash map sort of sructure

	use smaller cache to index larger memory segement
	have lowest three bits wit a block cache and use the lower three bits to address the corresponding block AND cache


	BLOCK ADDRESS IS SYNONTMOUS WITH WORD ADDRESS 

	all cache map tables have a valid bit
		0 = invalid
		1 = valid
