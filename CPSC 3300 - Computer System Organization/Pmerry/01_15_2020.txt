Components of computers

Computer
------------------------------------------------+
Processor 	| Memory 	| Devices	|

	"Brawn"	| prog here	| output	|
		| when run	|		|
------------------------------------------------+
- Von Neumann Architectures

Datapath - performs operations on data

Control: Sequences datapath, memory

Cache memory
	Small fast SRAM mem for immediate data access
		Sram means Static Ram
		Dram means Dynamic Ram
	This is VERY fast because it exists on the CPU



Inside the Processor
	GPU is built so the data path is floating point heavy
	
	L3 cache is usually nearby
	L2 cache is between cores
	L1 cache is in the core

Memory and Data Storage
	Volatile main memry
		Loses instr and data when powered off
	Non-Volatile Secondary memory
		Magnetic disk (hard drive)
		Flash Memory
		Optical Disk (CD, DVD)
	Tertiary storage
		Tapes

Manufacturing Integrated Circuits
	Integrated Circuit cost

	Cost Per die = Cost Per Wafer /(Dies per Wafer * Yeild)
	
	Dies per wafer ~= wafer area / die area

	Yeild = 1/(1+(defects per area*Die per area/2))^2

	There is a nonlinear relation to area and defect rate
		Wafer cost and area are fixed
		Defect rate determined by manufacturing process
		Die area determined by architecture and circuit design

	Define performance as 1/execution time
		Performance of x / perf of y = execution time x / execution time y = n

	Elapsed time
		The total response time including ALL aspects
			Processing, i/o, OS overhead, idle time, etc

		Determines system performance
	
	CPU time
		Time spent processing a given job
			discount IO time, other job's shares
		Comprises user CPU time and system CPU time
		Different programs are affected differently by CPU and system performance
	
CPU Hardware
	Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant rate clock

	Clock Cycles			|
	Data Transfer and Computation	|	G R A P H
	Update State			|


Program CPU Time
	CPU time Equation

	PErformance improved by
		Reducing number of prog clock cycles
		
		Increasing Clock Rate
		
		Hardware Designer must trade off against cycle count 	


Homework 1
	Available on canvas
	Submit a Word Doc or PDF
	Use one of the school of computing Linux machines for timing 
		Use perf tool (will give ans in microseconds, or it can)
		provide ans in milliseconds
	Figure out commands and options of perf are needed for experiments
	Due Wednesday Jan 29 

	
	Read CHPT 1.4-1.7; Zybooks participation activities as well
